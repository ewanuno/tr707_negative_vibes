# tr707_negative_vibes
this is a kicad project for a dc/dc converter for the roland tr707 and 727 drum machine. it can replace the negative dc supply with the hard to find Sumida coil in the tr707.

it takes the nominal 12v input voltage and transforms it to a nominal negative 10v

it is based on an ICL7660 negative voltage dc/dc converter.
the design is based on and idea by harry axten who makes a really nice eprom swap mod for the tr707.

Always check random designs from the internet before connecting them to your precious drum machine.

i will probably respond to messages but i don't officially offer support. and i probably can't answer any questions that the ICL7660 datasheet and TR707 service manual don't already answer.
